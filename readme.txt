== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will this plugin work with adWords? =

Yes! it works with any marketing scripts.

= Will it conflict with other plugins?=

It uses jQuery to insert the scripts so as long as jquery is included in your theme you should not have any problem, remember that
if your script has javascript errors, the plugin put the scripts as is so check your code in case you see javascript errors. or try removing it and see if that is the problem, or you can drop me en email and I will help you get it right.
